Logging module will be probably removed:

(17:41:04) ozizka-FN: lincolnthree:  Should we really have a logging module, or can it be in the Exec Impl?
(17:41:13) LincolnBaxter: ozizka: logging module probably not required
(17:41:46) ozizka-FN: Because, logging will be everywhere, so, putting it in exec seems to be okay
(17:41:55) ozizka-FN: even with potential JBoss logging dependency
(17:43:03) LincolnBaxter: yeah. that's definitely true
